# 🍔 Restaurant Ordering App

## 🧠 Development Focus: "The Engine"
In this version, I focused heavily on the **separation of concerns**. 
1.  **Data:** Isolated the menu items into a separate data file for scalability.
2.  **Logic:** Implemented a "Single Source of Truth" for the order state, ensuring the UI always reflects the current cart contents.
3.  **UI:** Maintained a "Green-Square" consistency by pushing UI improvements and logic updates in separate, documented layers.
